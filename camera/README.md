# camera

This folder contains an example code and the libraries necessary for using the VC0706 camera.
A series of adjustments has been made for the already existing library for VC0706. However, the library only worked for different arduino platforms and not the photon board.

The library has also been adjusted to the requirements of our IOT project. For instance we do not need any motion detection functionality, so we did not include it in the VC0706 library.
